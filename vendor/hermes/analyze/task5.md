# Task 5: Peewee ORM Industrial Bug Fixing

You are participating in a code-agent capability benchmark. Work only in the
current benchmark workspace and keep all dependency installation, test runs, and
grading inside the Docker environment named `@@DOCKER_SERVICE@@` whenever Docker
is available.

Set the model run name first:

```bash
MODEL_NAME="@@MODEL_NAME@@"
```

## Migrated task assets

- Source template: `@@BENCHMARK_ROOT@@/task5_source/`
- Hidden tests: `@@BENCHMARK_ROOT@@/task5_tests/`
- Task metadata: `@@BENCHMARK_ROOT@@/task5.yaml`
- Working copy: `@@RUN_DIR@@`
- Results directory: `@@RESULTS_DIR@@`

Do not modify `task5_source/`, `task5_tests/`, `task5.yaml`, or the shared
`task_project_*.py` helper files. Prepare an isolated working copy before
editing:

```bash
docker compose exec @@DOCKER_SERVICE@@ bash -lc '
  cd @@BENCHMARK_ROOT@@ &&
  python -m pip install -r task_project_requirements.txt &&
  python task_project_prepare.py --model "@@MODEL_NAME@@" --task 5 --force
'
```

## Objective

Fix the bundled Peewee ORM implementation so as many hidden tests as possible
pass. The core project includes `peewee.py`, `playhouse/`, and `pwiz.py`; most
known defects are concentrated in `peewee.py`.

Known symptoms include:

1. Integer fields are read back as floats.
2. Datetime parsing loses microsecond precision.
3. Nested savepoint behavior is inverted.
4. `Model.get_or_create()` returns the wrong `created` flag for existing rows.
5. `SELECT DISTINCT` is ignored.
6. Pagination has an off-by-one error.
7. `ASC` and `DESC` ordering are reversed.
8. Empty `IN` clauses match all rows.
9. `NULL` comparisons use `=` instead of `IS`.
10. `count()` returns `None` on empty tables instead of `0`.

You may run focused tests while debugging, but the official score must come from:

```bash
docker compose exec @@DOCKER_SERVICE@@ bash -lc '
  cd @@BENCHMARK_ROOT@@ &&
  python task_project_evaluate.py --model "@@MODEL_NAME@@" --task 5 --submit-index 1
'
```

You may submit up to three times by incrementing `--submit-index`.

## Final report

Create `@@RESULTS_DIR@@/task5_report.md` with:

1. Working directory path.
2. Files changed.
3. Bugs fixed.
4. Commands actually run.
5. Official evaluation results for each submit.
6. Best pass count or metric.
7. Whether the `720 / 801` threshold was reached.
8. Confirmation that the original `task5_source/` tree was not edited.
